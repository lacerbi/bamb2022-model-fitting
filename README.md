### Toolboxes for model fitting

The tutorials use the following open-source toolboxes. For your convenience, they are already included in this repo:
- *Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search* (BADS) optimization algorithm: https://github.com/lacerbi/bads
- *Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo* (VBMC) inference algorithm: https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc
