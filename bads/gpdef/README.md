# Gaussian process (GP) definition

This folder contains *GP definition files*. 

A GP definition file sets up the GP mean, covariance, and likelihood functions, and associated priors over GP hyperparameters. At the moment, BADS only supports `gpdefBads`, which includes a number of standard stationary covariance functions, and specific choices for the hyperpriors as described in the **Supplementary Material** (**Table S1**).
