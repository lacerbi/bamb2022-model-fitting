# Gaussian processes (GP) toolbox extra functions

This folder contains a number of additional MATLAB functions that extend the [GPML toolbox](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) [1], mostly to increase computational efficiency of gradient computations.
Some of these functions are based on the [GPML extensions](https://github.com/rmgarnett/gpml_extensions) by Roman Garnett.

Note that BADS was developed based on the GPML Toolbox v3.6; the more recent v4.0 solves some of the issues that we dealt with here. Future versions of BADS might upgrade to GPML v4.0.
